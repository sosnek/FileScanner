# FileScanner

Filescanner uses the virus total API to retrieve virus scan analytics using REST API calls.

## Requirements

A virus total account will be required in order for you to obtain your own API key.
If you do not already have one, you can sign up [here](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/sign-in)

## Usage

Grab your virus total API key by clicking on your profile on the top right of your window.
Select a file to scan by clicking the file icon next to the first line, or by pasting the file path on the first line. Paste your API key on the line below.
